- 👋 Hello, I’m @Galliummind A.K.A Louis
- 👀 I’m interested in ... javascript, Java, HTML, CSS, dipping my toe in everything right now.
- 🌱 I’m currently a beginner programmer. At the moment I am learning Javascript on my own while I study for a bachelor in CS and working in the Video production technology industry. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in some projects, but I am still learning on how best to do so. If you wouldn't mind someone new let me know. Right now I am working on creating bots in discord.
- 📫 Best way to reach me for now is through gitHub. 

For some special music that is great for programming. Check out [DOOM RADIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEuAYnjtJP0)
